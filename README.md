LocalizationScanner is a command-line tool that helps you identify localization issues in your Apple platform projects. It scans your project files for 
hardcoded strings and missing NSLocalizedString entries. This utility simplifies the localization process by providing an easy way to find potential 
issues and generate a report.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Running the script

```bash
swift run LocalizationScanner [--file-extensions <file-extensions> ...] [--excluded-directories <excluded-directories> ...] [--output-file-name <output-file-name>] [<scan-path>]
```

## üêä Arguments

- `<scan-path>`: path to the directory to scan. (default: current directory)
- ```-f, --file-extensions <file-extensions>```: The file extensions to search for. (default: swift, xib, m, storyboard)
- ```-e, --excluded-directories <excluded-directories>```: The directories to exclude from the search. (default: Pods, Tests, UITests, UnitTests)
- ```-o, --output-file-name <output-file-name>```: The name of the output file. (default: output.txt)
- ```-h, --help```: Show help information.

## üò± Non-localised strings

If you come across a file that uses non-localised strings but their use is necessary, there are commands to skip them when scanning:

- `locscanner:disable` and `locscanner:enable` - disables scanning in a given range
- `locscanner:ignore` - disables scanning for the whole file

### üî≠ Example:

```swift
final class ExampleImpl: Example {
    ...
    // locscanner:disable
    static let veryImportantName: String = "iPhone Kirchberg"
    // locscanner:enable
    ...
}
```

## üìù Editing

When modifying the source code, you must invoke the following command:

```bash
swift build && swift run LocalizationScanner [--file-extensions <file-extensions> ...] [--excluded-directories <excluded-directories> ...] [--output-file-name <output-file-name>] [<scan-path>]
```

File output is in the `output.txt` file unless you specify otherwise.

## ü§Ø Troubleshooting

If you don't build the utility with `swift build` or `swift run` commands, you need to delete the hidden folder `./build` and rebuild again. You can see the hidden folders by using the key combination: `Shift+‚åò+.`.
